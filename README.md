# BezierCurves_tut01
Code to accompany the tutorial on DeamInCode.net regarding simple Bezier curves.

## What this code does
This code is responsible for taking in a set of control points for a Bezier curve where the 
points are either soft or hard controls (as defined in the tutorial -- link below). After reading 
in the control points the program calculates the intermediate steps (X and Y coordinates) and 
printsthem to the standard output for future use. This program does not by any means graph the 
points, however that is easy enough to do through a spreadsheet program of your choice.
